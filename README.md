The Apple desktop maintenance app for our partners should have entries for four pieces of equipment:

1. Text printer
2.  Cover printer
3.  Binder
4.  Cutter(edited)

** The app needs to collect usage data. Based on the usage, we will tell them to do certain maintenance procedures.

- For the text printer, it will be based on pages printed and how many days a week they use it.

- For the cover printer it will be based on how many hours a day and how many days a week they use it.(edited)

- For the binder it will be based on how many books are bound, how many days a week they use it and how long they leave it on per day.(edited)

- For the cutter, it will be based on how many books are cut on it.(edited)

- Partners need to be reminded weekly to fill out this form.

- Each partner and print system needs to have a unique identifier.

- Data needs to be stored on the local machine and also be sent back to our server.(edited)
